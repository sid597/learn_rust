# Bringing Paths into Scope with the use Keyword

It might seem like the paths we’ve written to call functions so far are inconveniently long and repetitive. Fortunately, there’s a way to simplify this process. We can bring a path into a scope once and then call the items in that path as if they’re local items with the use keyword.


```sh
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;


pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

fn main() {}
```


- Bringing the function’s parent module into scope with use so we have to specify the parent module when calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined while still minimizing repetition of the full path. 

# Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large use Lists

If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module, listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our files. 

```sh
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};

```

-The common part of these two paths is `std::io`, and that’s the complete first path. To merge these two paths into one use statement, we can use `self` in the nested path

```sh
use std::io::{self, Write};
```


- If we want to bring all public items defined in a path into scope, we can specify that path followed by `*`, the glob operator:

```sh
use std::collections::*;
```

- Re-exporting Names with pub use 

```sh
pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
```
