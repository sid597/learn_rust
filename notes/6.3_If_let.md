# Concise Control Flow with if let


- The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to the `match` and the pattern is its first arm.

```
fn main() {
    let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
    if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
        println!("three");
    }
}
```
- Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code. However, you lose the exhaustive checking that match enforces. Choosing between `match` and `if let` depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.


## Summary
We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s `Option<T>` type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have data inside them, you can use `match` or `if let` to extract and use those values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.
