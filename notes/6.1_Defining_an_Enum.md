# Defining an Enum

 Why enums are useful and more appropriate than structs in some case. Say we need to work with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses: version four and version six. These are the only possibilities for an IP address that our program will come across: we can enumerate all possible variants, which is where enumeration gets its name.

 Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data structure appropriate, because enum values can only be one of its variants. 



 ```sh
// Create an `enum` to classify a web event. Note how both
// names and type information together specify the variant:
// `PageLoad != PageUnload` and `KeyPress(char) != Paste(String)`.
// Each is different and independent.
enum WebEvent {
    // An `enum` may either be `unit-like`,
    PageLoad,
    PageUnload,
    // like tuple structs,
    KeyPress(char),
    Paste(String),
    // or c-like structures.
    Click { x: i64, y: i64 },
}

// A function which takes a `WebEvent` enum as an argument and
// returns nothing.
fn inspect(event: WebEvent) {
    match event {
        WebEvent::PageLoad => println!("page loaded"),
        WebEvent::PageUnload => println!("page unloaded"),
        // Destructure `c` from inside the `enum`.
        WebEvent::KeyPress(c) => println!("pressed '{}'.", c),
        WebEvent::Paste(s) => println!("pasted \"{}\".", s),
        // Destructure `Click` into `x` and `y`.
        WebEvent::Click { x, y } => {
            println!("clicked at x={}, y={}.", x, y);
        },
    }
}

fn main() {
    let pressed = WebEvent::KeyPress('x');
    // `to_owned()` creates an owned `String` from a string slice.
    let pasted  = WebEvent::Paste("my text".to_owned());
    let click   = WebEvent::Click { x: 20, y: 80 };
    let load    = WebEvent::PageLoad;
    let unload  = WebEvent::PageUnload;

    inspect(pressed);
    inspect(pasted);
    inspect(click);
    inspect(load);
    inspect(unload);
}

}
```

- The variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we use a double colon to separate the two.

- The reason this is useful is that now all values ` WebEvent::PageLoad`, ` WebEvent::PageUnload` are of the same type i.e `webEvenvt`. Now we can use this 
feature to define a function that takes any `webEvent` type.

- There’s another advantage to using an `enum` rather than a `struct`: each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data. 

```sh
enum IpAddr {
        V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```


** Another Example ** 

```
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

- Defining an `enum` with variants such as the ones in Listing above is similar to defining different kinds of `struct` definitions, except the `enum` doesn’t use the `struct` keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the `Message` type.

-  The following `structs` could hold the same data that the preceding `enum` variants hold:

```
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
```

- But if we used the different `structs`, which each have their own type, we couldn’t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as we could with the `Message enum`

- Just as we defined function in `struct` we can define them in `enum` also:

```
 impl Message {
        fn call(&self) {
            // method body would be defined here
        }
    }

    let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
    m.call();
 ```

 ## The Option Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values

 - This section explores a case study of `Option`, which is another enum defined by the standard library. The `Option` type is used in many places because it encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be *something or it could be nothing*.

 - Rust doesn’t have the null feature that many other languages have. *Null* is a value that means there is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of two states: null or not-null.

- The problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a not-null value, you’ll get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null property is pervasive, it’s extremely easy to make this kind of error.

- As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is Option<T>

```
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

- The Option<T> enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; you don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly.

Here are some examples of using Option values to hold number types and string types:

```
    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_string = Some("a string");

    let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```
