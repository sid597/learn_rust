# Common Collections

- Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called collections

- Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.

- In this chapter, we’ll discuss three collections that are used very often in Rust programs:

    * A vector allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.

    * A string is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the String type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.
    * A hash map allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a map.


- Rust's collections can be grouped into four major categories:

    * Sequences: Vec, VecDeque, LinkedList
    * Maps: HashMap, BTreeMap
    * Sets: HashSet, BTreeSet
    * Misc: BinaryHeap
