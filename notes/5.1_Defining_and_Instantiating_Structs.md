# Defining and Instantiating Structs

 Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. 

 ```sh
 struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

- To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields.
-  We don’t have to specify the fields in the same order in which we declared them in the struct.
- To get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation.
-  If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a particular field.
- **NOTE :** The entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable.

## Using the Field Init Shorthand when Variables and Fields Have the Same Name

```sh
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax

```sh
let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
        active: user1.active,
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};
```

- Above listing  shows how we create a new User instance in user2 without the update syntax.

```sh
let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
        ..user1
};
```

## Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types

You can also define structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs. Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields. 

```sh
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```
