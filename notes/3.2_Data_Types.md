# Data Types

- Keep in mind that Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must
know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer
what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

- There are two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

### Scalar Types

###### Integer Types

- Signed integer types start with i, unsigned integers start with u

|Length | Signed	|Unsigned|
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|8-bit	|i8	|u8|
|16-bit	|i16	|u16|
|32-bit	|i32	|u32|
|64-bit	|i64	|u64|
|128-bit	|i128	|u128|
|arch	|isize	|usize|

- Signed numbers are stored using two’s complement representation.Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses.

- Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on

- There are following types of integer literals in Rust

|Number literals|	Example|
| ------ | ------ |
|Decimal	|98_222|
|Hex	|0xff|
|Octal	|0o77|
|Binary	|0b1111_0000|
|Byte (u8 only)|	b'A'|


- If you’re unsure, Rust’s defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to i32: this type is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems.
