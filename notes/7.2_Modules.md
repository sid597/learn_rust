# Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy

- Modules let us organize code within a crate into groups for readability and easy reuse.

- Modules also control the privacy of items, which is whether an item can be used by outside code (public) or is an internal implementation detail and not available for outside use (private).

```sh
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}

fn main() {}
```


```sh
crate
 └crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
```

- This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside one another (for example, hosting nests inside front_of_house). 

- The tree also shows that some modules are siblings to each other, meaning they’re defined in the same module (hosting and serving are defined within front_of_house)

-  To continue the family metaphor, if module A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the child of module B and that module B is the parent of module A.
